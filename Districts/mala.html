    <h1>Malappuram</h1>
    <p id="descrpition">Malappuram (/mələppurəm/ (About this soundlisten)) is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala, with a coastline of 70 km (43 mi). It is the most populous district of Kerala, which is home to around 13% of the total population of the state.[13] The district was formed on 16 June 1969, spanning an area of about 3,554 km2 (1,372 sq mi). It is the third-largest district of Kerala by area. It is also the largest district of Kerala bounded by Western Ghats and Arabian Sea on the eastern and the western borders respectively. It is the third major contributing district to the Gross State Domestic Product of Kerala as of 2019, after Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram.[14]

        The eastern part of the district is hilly and the western part is coastal region. Eranad, Kondotty, Nilambur, Perinthalmanna, Ponnani, Tirur, and Tirurangadi, are the seven subdistricts included in the district. Malayalam is the most spoken language. Religions practised in the district include Islam, Hinduism, and Christianity. The district has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large Malayali expatriate community.[15] It was the first e-literate district and the first cyber literate district of India.</p>

                <p>The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures.
