    <h1>Kasaragod</h1>
    <p id="descrpition">Kasaragod and anglicised to Kassergode is one of the 14 districts in the southern Indian state of Kerala. It is the northernmost district of Kerala and is included in the North Malabar region. It is also known as Saptha Bhasha Sangama Bhoomi (The land of seven languages), as seven languages namely Malayalam, Tulu, Kannada, Marathi, Konkani, Beary, and Urdu are spoken, unlike the other districts of Kerala.[1] It was a part of the Kannur district of Kerala until 24 May 1984. The district is bounded by Dakshina Kannada district to the north, Western Ghats to the northeast, Kodagu district to the southeast, Kannur district to the south, and Arabian Sea to the west. Kasaragod district has the maximum number of rivers in Kerala. Kasaragod was known to the Arabs by the name Harkwillia.[9] Many Arab travelers visiting Kerala between the 9th and the 14th centuries visited Kasaragod, being an important trade centre then. Duarte Borbosa, a Portuguese traveler who visited Kumbla, near Kasargod in 1514 recorded that rice being exported for coir to Maldives.[9] According to Barbosa, the people in the southwestern Malabar coast of India from Kumbla in the north to Kanyakumari in the south had spoke a unique language, which they called as "Maliama" (Malayalam).[10] If he is right, then Kumbla would be the northern end of Malayalam region in the first quarter of 16th century CE. </p>
