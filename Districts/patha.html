    <h1> Pathanamthitta</h1>
    <p id="descrpition">Pathanamthitta District is a district in the southern part of Kerala, India. The district headquarters is in the town of Pathanamthitta. There are four municipalities in Pathanamthitta: Tiruvalla, Adoor, Pathanamthitta and Pandalam.

        According to the 2011 Census of India, the population was 1,197,412,[2] making it the third least populous district in Kerala (out of 14), after Wayanad and Idukki.[3] Pathanamthitta has been declared the first polio-free district in India.[4] The district is 10.03% urbanised.[5] Pathanamthitta is one of the richest districts in India with just 1.17% poverty as of 2013, which places the district among top 5 districts in India with least poverty.It is presumed that the regions that form the district were formerly under the rule of Pandalam, which had connections with the Pandya kingdom.[8] When Pandalam was added to the princely state of Travancore in 1820, the region came under Travancore administration.

        The district was formed on 1 November 1982 in the interest of speeding up development. The formation was done by incorporating various portions of the erstwhile Kollam, Alappuzha and Idukki districts. While the taluks Pathanamthitta, Adoor, were taken from Kollam district, Ranni, Konni and Kozhencherry from Idukki district, Pandalam and Thiruvalla were taken from Alappuzha district.</p>
