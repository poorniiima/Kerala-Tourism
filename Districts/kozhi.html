    <h1>Kozhikode</h1>
    <p id="descrpition">Kozhikode or Calicut district, in the central part of the former Malabar district, is a district of Kerala state, on the southwest coast of India. The city of Kozhikode, also known as Calicut, is the district headquarters. The district is 38.25% urbanised.[3]

        Kozhikode district is bordered by the districts of Kannur and Mahé (Puducherry) to the north, Wayanad to the east, and Malappuram to the south. The Arabian Sea lies to the west and Western Ghats stretches towards east. Vavul Mala is the highest peak in the district. It lies between latitudes 11° 08'N and 11° 50'N and longitudes 75° 30'E and 76° 8'E.
        
        The district is divided into four taluks: Kozhikode, Vatakara, Koyilandy and Thamarassery. By the 2011 census there are 12 block panchayats: Balusseri, Chelannur, Koduvally, Kozhikode, Kunnamangalam, Kunnummal, Melady, Panthalayani, Perambra, Thodannur, Thuneri and Vatakara.[4] Wayanad district and Malappuram district were formed by taking parts of erstwhile Kozhikode district.</p>

                    Kozhikode Beach</h5>
                <p>Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.

                <p>Take a break from daily life and pay a visit to the Srikanteshwara Temple in Kozhikode. On your visit to Kerala, you must add this temple to your list of places to see in Kozhikode.   More than a hundred years old, this temple is dedicated to Lord Shiva and is a must-visit pilgrimage of Hindus. Apart from Lord Shiva, you can worship Lord Ganapathy, the serpent Gods, and Lord Krishna.

                    Kakkayam Dam</h5>
                <p>Kakkayam Dam is a famous picnic spot around Kozhikode because of its scenic beauty and plenty of choices for outdoor activities. Though the dam is small in size, it more than compensates with the small waterfalls around it. Take a peek at the varieties of animals and birds that inhabit the place. Or take a boat ride along the dam and see the small waterfalls and dense forests that surround the dam. Move around and soak in the scenic beauty of the hills around the dam.
